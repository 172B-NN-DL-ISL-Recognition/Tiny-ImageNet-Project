#Image Classification Model on Tiny ImageNet Dataset

This repository contains code for training and evaluating an efficient image classification model on the Tiny ImageNet dataset using TensorFlow, PyTorch and Keras.
I have manily focused on DataLoaders (Data Wrangling and exploration of Multi-Layer-CNN model.

Dataset

The Tiny ImageNet dataset is a subset of the ImageNet dataset and consists of 200 classes. It contains 100,000 training images, 10,000 validation images, and 10,000 test images. Each image has a size of 64x64 pixels and is classified into one of the 200 classes.

Download the Tiny ImageNet dataset from the official website (http://cs231n.stanford.edu/tiny-imagenet-200.zip).
